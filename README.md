# Linear Regression on FuelConsumption Dataset
 
In this project, our goal is to fill-in the gaps of a detaset with the help of predicting statistical analysis and use the best feature to predict output using linear regression method. First of all, we want to fill-in the empty cells using different metods such as fill them with the mean number of other existing numbers in that column and then discuss about them. Accordingly, we are going to find a Hypothesis Function to find the best model for our dataset, which can estimate the target column by considering one of the features in .csv file. Finally, we need to analyze wich of the features in the file, is the best feature to be used as a measure, in order to predict the output, which is the fuel consumption. As a result, we can predict some missing datas and also our target outputs, using other available datas and their distribudistributions.
