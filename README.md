# Linear Regression on FuelConsumption Dataset
 
In this project, we are about to use linear regression on fuelconsumption dataset which can be found on this repository. first we want to fill-in the empty cells using different metods such as fill them with mean number of other existing numbers in that column and then discuss about them. then we are going to find a Hypothesis Function, to find the best model for our dataset, wich can estimate the target column by considering one of the features in .csv file, . also, we need to analyze wich of the features in the file, is the best feature to be used as a measure, in order to predict the output, wich is the fuel consumption. 

FuelConsumption.csv file which is our dataset looks like this:
